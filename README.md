# Boost Cart
Based on (and fully compatible with) the mod "carts" by PilzAdam
and the one contained in the subgame "minetest_game".
Target: Run smoothly as possible, even on laggy servers.

## Features
- A fast cart for your railway or roller coaster
- Easily configurable cart speed using the Advanced Settings
- Boost and brake rails
- By mesecons controlled Start-Stop rails
- Detector rails that send a mesecons signal when the cart drives over them
- Rail junction switching with the 'right/left' walking keys
- Handbrake with the 'back' key
- Support for non-minetest_game subgames

## Settings
This mod can be adjusted to fit the preference of a player or server. Use the `Settings -> All Settings` dialog in the main menu or tune your
minetest.conf file manually:

#### `boost_cart.speed_max = 10`
* Maximal speed of the cart in m/s
* Possible values: 1 ... 100

#### `boost_cart.punch_speed_max = 7`
* Maximal speed to which the driving player can accelerate the cart by punching from inside the cart.
* Possible values: -1 ... 100
* Value `-1` will disable this feature.
